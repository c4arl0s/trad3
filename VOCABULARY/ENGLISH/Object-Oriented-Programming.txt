Object-Oriented-Programming:OOP:OOP split apart the program into self-contained objects. Each object represents a part of the system that gets mapped to a distinc entity . Basically, an object functions as a separate program by itself. It operates on its own data and has a specific role.::::The objects that form the system interact with each other. Object-orientation aims to bring the world of programming closer to the real world.
