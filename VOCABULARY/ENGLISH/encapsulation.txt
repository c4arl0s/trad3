encapsulaci√≥n:encapsulation:We encapsulate something to protect it and keep its parts together. Encapsulation is usually defined as one of two things, 1. A mechanism by which information (code) is hidden. 2. A construct for bundling data together. The grouping of data and computations on the data into one class is called encapsulation.::::Frameworks embody another of these core principles, encapsulation.
