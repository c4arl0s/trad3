# DictEnEsScript

This is a new repository for my script trad3. It translate in a basic way an English word to Spanish and viceversa.
It use my own database which come from my old days of school. When I just needed to understand a word I just looked for it in a dictionary, and put it in a txt file. This txt files when the time past by it becomes a large data base of words, this script access to it and also make a request to find it in google translate web service in case the word does not exist. 

Next step would be to make an app and access all these words from a Firebase database. Lets make it.!
